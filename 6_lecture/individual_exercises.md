What is the difference between a function and a use case?

A use case is something an actors as part of one of their work tasks. Maybe it is to enter an order. A function is something that connects actors and our model. In this case that would mean that we have a function create order, which makes an order object within the model.

What are the four different function types?

- update
- read
- compute
- signal

# OOA&D, section 7.6, exercise 5 (page 149).
Which sources are used to identify functions?

See slides 30-33.

# OOA&D, section 7.6, exercise 7 (page 149).
How can the functional requirements be evaluated?

- Completeness:
    - Let the users review the list of functions
    - Use the questions for each function type to exhaust that category
    - Compare with the system definition, the model, and the use cases.
- Make experiments and prototypes
    - To check the use cases
    - To check the set of functions
